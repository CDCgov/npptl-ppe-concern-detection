# Description

Code to accompany Payne and Haas, “Detecting PPE concerns in OSHA complaints using machine learning to support infectious disease outbreak response” (submitted). 

## Repository organization

### Data 
A zipped directory containing raw data, `00_data-raw/`, is available with the initial release. Download this directory to the repository and unzip. All raw data used are publicly available:

- [CDC: Weekly Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 Hospitalizations from the COVID-NET Surveillance System](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-COVID-19-Hosp/6jg4-xsqq/about_data)
- [U.S. Census Bureau: North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)](https://www.census.gov/naics/)
- [Department of Labor: OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/foia)

### Workflow

#### Setup Python environment
- Install conda.
- In your terminal, run `conda env create environment.yml -n npptl-ppe-concern-detection-env` to create the conda environment.
- In your terminal, run `conda activate npptl-ppe-concern-detection-env` to activate the conda environment. Ensure you activate the environment in any high-performance computing job scripts.
- In your terminal, type `libretranslate --load-only en,es` to run the LibreTranslate API server, which we use to locally translate Spanish complaints into English (note: there is no space between `en` and `es`). You should see "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000." Run all subsequent code in a separate terminal window.

#### Clean data
Run scripts in `01_clean-data/` in the following order.
- `01_merge-naics.py` merges OSHA dataset with NAICS datasets to get descriptive industry sector titles.
- `02_detect-language.py` detects the language of all complaints.
- `03_translate-spanish-to-english.py` translates Spanish narratives into English. 
- `03_filter-ppe.py` identifies PPE-related complaints, i.e., those with narratives containing at least one keyword from `ppe_terms.csv`.
- `05_cleanup.r` performs additional cleaning tasks.

An R function is available `utils/helper_functions.r` to facilitate downstream data cleaning when reloading OSHA complaints data for processing and visualization in R.

#### Sample complaints
`sample-complaints.py` produces a sample of 3,200 complaints and a version of the sample retaining only complaints with distinct hazard narratives that will eventually constitute the labeled dataset.

#### PPE coding
At this point, the PPE concerns in distinct hazard narratives among sampled complaints would be manually labeled. See paper for details. The labeled dataset annotated by the authors and accompanying data dictionary are provided in `03_ppe-coding/` as `ml_dataset.csv` and `ml_dataset_data_dictionary.csv`, respectively. Descriptive statistics for PPE-related complaints and the ML dataset can be found in `descriptives.ipynb`.

#### Fine-tune DistilBERT model and generate out-of-sample predictions
Run scripts in `04_distilbert/` in the following order.

- `distilbert_multilabel_cv_[0-9].py`: These scripts fine-tune DistilBERT models on the labeled dataset and record evaluation metrics over 150 train-test splits.
- `predict_oos_m[0-2].py`: Each of these prediction scripts uses one of the 150 previously fine-tuned models generate a set of out-of-sample predictions for all PPE-related complaints that were not among the 3,200 initially sampled. The three sets of out-of-sample predictions are combined via (entrywise) majority vote to generate one vector-valued label for each out-of-sample complaint.

#### Create tables and figures summarizing results
The directory `05_results/` contains code to produce the tables and figures in the paper.

- `results_ml.ipynb` produces tables and figures summarizing the detection ability of the fine-tuned DistilBERT model. It also produces `04_distilbert/ppe_labeled.csv` which combines ML-labeled complaints and manually labeled (or inferred from manually labeled) complaints.
- `results_trends.ipynb` produces trend analyses in the paper.
