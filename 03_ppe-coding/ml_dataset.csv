Appropriate and state mandated protocol is not being followed in order to ensure employee and customer safety. First, temperatures of employees entering the building are not being taken at all. The only time someone gets their temperature taken is when the individual requests to have their temperature taken, at that point we are told to do it ourselves, which increases risk of exposure due to increased touching of a service, and no sanitation happening in between uses. There is no log being kept of employee temperatures. Additionally, proper mask wearing in not being implemented. Employee¿s are wearing their masks below their noses, or even under their chins. Employees also remove their masks as soon as the restaurant closes to the public, and they then do their closing duties around other employees without social distancing or wearing masks. Even more concerning, we recently (last week) had an employee miss work due to Covid like symptoms, he posted on his social media about having a cough and a fever for over a week that he couldn't kick, and that it was the most sick he has ever been in his life. He claims to have taken a covid-19 test and got a negative result, but I do not believe proof of this was provided. He also came back to work 2 days after posting that he was so sick from fever that he felt like he was dying, and when he returned to work he still had a cough. I am unsure if his temperature was taken upon his return to work, but I feel it is highly unlikely. Our company protocol is that when you are sick you are supposed to be in communication with corporate and they make the determination of when it is safe to return to work, however our management has not enforced this protocol, and they are taking it upon themselves to make the determination of when a sick employee can return ( corporate suggests 3 days after being symptom free, however management approved return while said employee still has symptoms).

My trainer squirted hand sanitizer on a Kleenex and handed it to me to ¿clean off¿ the blood pressure cuff, O2 saturation monitor & thermometer. 3. On March 19th as I entered the facility to get me temperature checked I observed another staff person registered a temperature of 100.9 degrees F. I said to the staff member you can¿t work with that temperature. She stated, ¿oh hell no!¿ and punched in to work. Staff are working (or being required to work) with elevated temperatures. 4. During both shifts, my trainer would stand right next to me and cough on me. I asked her several time to not cough on me. She stated that she had a mask on, so she did not have to cover her cough and it was a smoker¿s cough, so she wasn¿t sick or spreading germs. 5. There were already two cases of influenza on the unit and no PPE for those rooms. The two infected individuals were sharing rooms with other residents who were not positive for influenza. 6. I sent an email to the Assistant Administrator on Sunday, March 22nd, stating that I did not feel safe working in these conditions. I was contacted by Human Resources on Monday, March 23rd. I explained what was going on and why I felt this was unsafe for staff to work under these conditions and that it was potentially deadly for the residents. 7. I was scolded for missing a training shift on Monday. I explained that I had a temperature of 100.6 degrees F. and according to their guidelines I was not eligible to work. I was instructed that I had to finish my training. I explained that I was sick and possibly contagious. I was told that did not matter, I must come to work and complete my training. 8. I was taken off the schedule. All of my shifts were removed. I was later told that since I didn¿t show up for shifts, they were taken away. I was given ¿separation¿ papers and summarily terminated.

"C-1668957","Bus drivers are not being provided with cloth masks to protect them from COVID19 rather than with the more effective N95 or KN95 shields. In October my employer plans to resume boarding passengers via the front door of the bus to collect fares. Drivers are not allowed to refuse service to passengers not wearing masks. The plexiglass shield we have had installed recently on our coaches are not air tight. All they do is protect the driver from any direct sneeze or cough. They do not protect us from aerosol contamination. In July we were told we would be provided with both the shield and N95 or KN95 masks before they would resume front door boarding. Now I am concerned that we will not be provided with anything more than cloth masks even after we start front door boarding. They gave us KN95 masks during the smoky conditions from the fires but the sign at my base said they were only for during the fires. In addition to this the plexiglass shields they have installed present a distracting and hazardous glare to drivers during day time hours. We are being told we have to manually open and shut these doors at every stop until they are able to make them automated. So for two reasons these new shields are not safe. They create distractions and glare that could result in accidents or injury, and they will certainly cause L&I injury to drivers because of the repetitive motion of having to manually open and close them at every stop (and on hills these shields are very hard to open. I will also add that the anxiety is very high for some of us older drivers whenever we have passengers on our buses refusing to wear masks. I have personally received death threats from passengers for asking them to wear a mask? and i haven?t noticed any increased police protection against assault. The shields we have been given can easily be opened by an assailant, trapping us in our seats. And we can do nothing about it. We have been given no authority to deny service to people without masks and very soon we will have them walking right past us & paying a fare (or arguing with us about all the things passengers like to argue with drivers about) while we are not getting the protection we need nor are we receiving hazard pay.Last thing.

"C-1817036","1. Nursing staff works 12 hour shifts. Nurse patient ratio on the cardiac care unit is suppose to be 1/4. But it's almost always 1/6. And many times CNAs are 1/12 patients. Overworked nursing staff under stressful conditions many times leads to miscommunication, mistakes and hazards. Which not only puts the staff in danger but the patients as well. It is this way on multiple units. Staff rarely get a lunch and even less time get any breaks. They usually grab bites of something between caring for patients. Nurses very Rarely leave the floor for a 30 minute lunch cause if we do we have to leave another nurse caring not only for their 4 to 6 patients they have to care for our 4 to 6 patients as well. That is too much for one nurse to do even if it is only for 30 minutes. This may not sound like a lot of patients for one nurse but these are critically ill patients.There are days the employee may only get to pee once or twice a day cause its so busy and doesn't have time. Other nurses tell the employee the same. This leads to us getting UTIs and sometimes even kidney infections. 2. Chairs in Alcoves have been complained about multiple times by staff because they are so slippery and have led to multiple staff slips and falls. These chairs are placed at each patient alcove and they are barstool type chairs with wheels that sit up high and when staff tries to climb up on the chairs they slide out from under us causing us to hit the floor or walls. When employee complained to their manager about it they were told, we should feel lucky we were even given chairs. If employee felt the chairs were dangerous they should not sit in them. According to my step count everyday, employee may walk anywhere from 6 to 11 miles per day at work. Employee needs to be able to sit down at least during their charting. In fear of losing our chairs employee doesn't complain anymore. 3. When the hospital transfers you out of your unit to work another unit that is short staffed they give you no training on this other unit first. Employee works the cardiac care unit. Employee has been trained on their unit. Last week August 25th, the employee was sent to work the COVID unit on 4th floor. Employee received no training prior to working this unit. And they do this to all nurses and CNAs. None of us get trained on units they pull us to that are short staffed. 4. Our units have limited N95 masks in a electronic supply box called the Omnicell. To get these out we have to go in and sign them out individually per person. Per the Cardiac care unit manager, staff are not allowed to sign these out unless we have a patient positive for COVID on our unit. But the hospital does not test every patient for COVID prior to coming to our unit. So we are taking care of patients for days. And find out days in that they have COVID and staff have not been allowed proper PPE to Care for Covid patients. For example we took care of a patient in room 331 for several days. Patient came in with a heart condition as well as respiratory issues. The patient was not tested for COVID when they came in through the ER. Patient should have been tested for COVID before they ever left the ER to come upstairs to our unit. So multiple nurses and aides took care of this patient for days and were not allowed to have the proper PPE. 5. We many times have patients who may be mentally unstable with confusion and are considered fall risks. These patients will get out of bed although they are asked to call for staff to help. We have alarms to tell us when they get up but many times by the time staff gets in there it's too late. Patient has already fallen. With these confused patients that are non compliant we are suppose to have sitters to come sit with them. But being so under staffed we many times can't get a sitter. So in turn this causes our staff to constantly have to run in patients rooms to try to prevent falls.

About Friday night, he/she informs a manager that they took a COVID-19 test sometime after Saturday, but before Friday to my knowledge and it came back positive. Now with this information it would be logical to at least have the exposed employees be sent home or even tested but it was failed to do so and they claimed that everyone there will be fine and that he/she the only one that is sick. Now, being up there I noticed that several employees were throwing up that Sunday night and were strongly encouraged to stay working even though everyone was getting sick. Several people called out of work because they could not bring themselves to come in due to their condition.

There has been no evidence of this deep cleaning at Locke school. I do not feel comfortable being in an environment that was not practicing CDC guidelines. I mentioned myu concerns in faculty meetings, and the principal did not have answers to the questions. I then wrote a letter to CPS Talent Office on October 26th with many other concerns regarding cleaning, health, and safety. On that same day, they responded by saying that if I respond to the intent to return form, they will put together a better plan of action for a safe return to school. Since then, teachers that were in the building did not see things getting better. They reported to me that things were worse. I was made aware that administrators and lunchroom staff were not wearing masks and not social distancing. Coffee cups and food wrappers were being left in teacher's classrooms. After bringing situations like this to the principal and the Talent Office, I did not see anything changing. I asked several questions in our meetings with the principal again. He did not have many answers to my questions. On January 2nd, I wrote a letter to the CEO of CPS. I understand she is busy, but I thought I would have heard from her or her office by now. On Thursday, January 7th, I was threatened to show up for work. I received another notice the next day; this time, the threat said I would not be paid.

He told the parent that there had been people in the building with COVID, but they did not get COVID from being at the school. How can he be sure of this? This is very alarming because CPS is supposed to report when they have cases at the schools. They have only reported one case at Locke School at this point. According to my principal, there have been parents, teachers, and a member of! the administrative team that has been in the building with COVID. Teachers in the building were not notified.

Fit testing is not being conducted on the types of respirators provided to staff to ensure a proper fit and seal. Nurses providing direct care to patients with confirmed COVID-19 are provided with gowns that are not fluid-resistant or impermeable and do not fully cover the back of the wearer. In addition, only one gown is provided per nurse per day, which creates additional infection control risk as the viral load on the gown becomes very high. Nurses are given one face shield per day and are told to clean them. The excessive use and cleaning process sometimes cause the face shield to break apart. Staff are not given access to additional face shields in a timely manner. This even includes nurses who are performing aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation on patients with confirmed COVID-19. Inconsistent or no training is provided to staff regarding safe donning and doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Some receive video training, some receive text messages, and some receive no training at all. 1910.134 Staff are not being fit tested on the N95 respirators currently being provided. Montefiore does not have a range of sizes and types of respirators available. The 3M model 1860 N95 respirator currently being provided to nurses is causing medical reactions in many wearers including headaches, skin irritation and skin infections. Montefiore is not conducting safe procedures for discarding and cleaning disposable respirators that are in compliance with manufacturer instructions. 3M and other disposable respirator manufactures have stated that there is no proven method to safely decontaminate disposable respirator models while maintaining the fit and integrity of the respirator.
